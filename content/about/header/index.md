  Hi, I'm Mar

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a jill-of-all-trades and master of some; an interdisciplinary generalist passionate about using computational and mathematical tools for data-intensive research. From uncovering insights to support evidence-based decision-making, to best practice approaches in research and development; all while sharing this knowledge to build communities of practice.

<!-- Previously I worked in public health, where I developed a mathematical model to optimise the allocation of medical diagnostic equipment for the World Bank, and used self-report and record linkage data (Medicare, PBS) to evaluate Melbourneâ€™s Medically Supervised Injecting Room for the Victorian Government. Before that I worked on physiology education and outreach, developing virtual experiments for teaching undergraduate students, and leading awareness activities in my role within the ARC Centre of Excellence for Integrative Brain Function, including a demonstration of a brain-computer interface to over 400 members of the general public.-->

I hold a BSc/MSc in Mathematics from the University of Cordoba, Argentina, and a PhD in computational and experimental neuroscience from Rutgers University, USA, where I studied how brain cells process visual information.
